// **1. Given a student&#39;s score, can you determine and return their corresponding letter grade (A,
// B, C, D, or F) using if-else statements?

// **2. Create a function that identifies whether a given integer is even or odd. Then, utilize a loop
// to analyze a list of numbers and print whether each number is even or odd.

// **3. Develop a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius based on
// user input. Use functions and conditional operators for this task.

// **4. Write a function to compute the factorial of a given number. Apply this function to calculate
// the factorial of numbers from 1 to 10.

// **5. Develop a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. Employ if-
// else statements and functions for this purpose.

// **6. Write a function to check if a number is prime. Then, use a loop to identify and print all
// prime numbers between 1 and 100.

// **7. Implement the FizzBuzz game using loops and if-else statements. Print numbers from 1 to
// 100, replacing multiples of 3 with &quot;Fizz,&quot; multiples of 5 with &quot;Buzz,&quot; and multiples of both 3 and 5
// with &quot;FizzBuzz.&quot;

// **8. Develop a program that counts the occurrences of a specific character in a given string.
// Use loops and functions for this task.

// **9. Build a calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
// using functions and conditional operators.

// **10. Write a program that calculates income tax based on the user&#39;s income bracket. Utilize if-
// else statements and functions for this computation.

// **11. Implement a function that computes the result of raising a number to a given power. Then,
// apply this function to calculate powers for various numbers and exponents.

// **12. Develop a menu-driven program that allows the user to select options for calculating area,
// perimeter, or volume of different shapes. Use functions, if-else statements, and user input for
// interaction.
